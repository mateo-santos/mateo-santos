## About me 

Hi I'm Mateo!ðŸ‘‹ I landed here to start showcasing some of my portfolio projects and building my path in the analytics field. So for now this is going to be used as a portfolio page, we'll see where this goes in the future :)

I enjoy playing with data visualization tools, being Power BI and Tableau the ones I use this far.

As a fun fact I can say I'm great at sneaking in to concerts. Can tell you my experiences later! Oh, regarding my experience in analytics... we can chat about that in an interview ;)
